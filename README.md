2017 and 2018 Analysis of 12 Stock Tickers
## Project Overview
Steve has elicited help in preparing a stock analyis for his parents with a set of 12 possible tickers for evaluation.  Utilizing VBA, we've attempted to create a functional tool that efficiently runs our script in the background to return a well formatted comparison of the 12 tickers with their Ticker Symbol, Total Daily Volume for the specified year and rate of return as a percentage.  

Steve's parents were particularly interested in Daqo (DQ), and this analysis attempts to show DQ's performance against 11 other options that meet Steve's and his parents' preference for Green Stocks.  After the initial analysis the code was refactored to improve performance and reprove the data set.

## Analysis
### DQ vs The Field
2018 proved to be a difficult year for the prospectus with only two tickers venturing into positive territory after a solid 2017.  DQ, coming off of a 2017 breakout with nearly 200% returns, faltered with losses exceeding 62%.  While DQ was the loss leader in 2018, a $1000 investment in the one stock would have garnered 137% ROI versus 59% returns had the investment been diversified across all 12 tickers.

### Code Refactored
Refactoring the code provided a modicum of efficiency with the limited datasets when the macros were run identically.  An average of 82% faster runs after the refactor is indicitave of material improvement should a larger swath of data be analyzed.
